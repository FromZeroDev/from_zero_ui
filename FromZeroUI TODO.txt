Table -- use better scroll shadow https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_scroll_shadow

Table -- allow passing headerRowModel, delete all weird parameters that exist right now

Table -- deprecate the widget types thing, Table will always return a sliver, parents will need to put it in a CustomScrollView
	remove both sticky packages used currently, use SliverTools instead
		use SliverTools for the sticky headers
			need to implement custom stickyOffset
		check if there's an easy way to add cards to the slivers
			preferably, added extarnally, before putting it in the CustomScrollController
			if that is not possible, add a boolean option addCards to the Table widget itself
		implement StickyFooter and add the Scrollbar there

Table -- Use a Map instead of a list for columns (in models and everywhere)
	this would allow columns to be added/removed/reordered easily

Table -- check what else can be removed (lots of unused stuff probably)

make Export use new FileSaverFromZero

Android -- popupFromZero and SnackBarFromZero don't resize for android keyboard offset appropriately

Bug with condition filters on table
	when all value filters are disabled (new way) and a condition filter is added, no values return true

??? force windows app to be executed as admin by default

Problems with excel export
	Excel breaks sometimes when copy/paste ????
	Export breaks when exporting large amounts of data (embarques 3 years)

WAITING bug with slivers tearing on windows, once it is solved, remove patches from Table

Table Feature -- Export to excel with right-click (directly on the table)

fix part of the screen not being draggable on really big screens
	maybe just deprecate limitWidthOnBigScreens
	
popupFromZero doesn't reposition child in response to window resize

Table -- Initial checking for filter values should be async (and also maybe other parts of initialization)
			??? also filtering, maybe
		filters will show loading until this finishes
		probably needs to be in an isolate
		??? only if rowCount > 100 ??? (also allow to force sync or async)

Windows Increase mouse wheel scroll speed and add anmation

GoRouter -- there should be a way to "push" a subtree, 
	this means the subtree will decide its normally with .go, but wont affect routes below it in the stack
		PROPOSAL:
			create a new custom routeDelegate, 
				that contains a goRouterDelegate and conveys everything to it
				add a new method pushRouter: 
					allows to push a new goRouter, with full functionality, on top of the new one
					when the last page of this new router is popped, the whole router will be popped, returning to previous one
					add an aditional initialRoute parameter when pushing new router
					? impact in the fromZeroScaffold page shenannigans
				! need to read more about default navigator2.0 documentation

Experiment: make Telegram-like scrollbars (leave option)
	scrollbar is not always visible
	add a MouseRegion: on enter whole region, trigger a fake movement to show scrollbar
	while inside the scrollbar region action range, keep showig it
	also show it once at start, then fade out on timing
	
Return to top button improvement: only show when there is certain space from beggining AND user is scrolling upwards, hide when scrolling down
	maybe add to ScrollbarFromZero by default (probably need to support horizontal scrolling for this)

implement PageIndicatorForZero
	indicator that 'slides' with a transition between values
	builders for the actual tab children, depending on selected value/index
	
implement DialogButton widget to streamline appearance

implement AlertDialogFromZero, taking simple parameters (title, message, onAccept, onCancel)
