!!!!!!!!! Textfield alt-64 blocks whole windows

!!!!!! Bug with slivers tearing !!!!!!!!!!!
		once it is solved, remove patches from Table

!!! fix part of the screen not being draggable on really big screens
	maybe just deprecate limitWidthOnBigScreens

!!! Windows Increase mouse wheel scroll speed and add anmation
	only when the mouse wheel is click (not smooth)
	
!!! Implement UIScaling + Scaling picker widget (with slider)
	take initial system textScale as UI scaling

! Scrollbar not updated on window resize
	noticeable in table horizontal scrollbars

popupFromZero and SnackBarFromZero don't resize for android keyboard offset appropriately

popupFromZero doesn't reposition child in response to window resize

popupFromZero improvement: on dektop, popup should not block content behind it by default (use Overlay)

Experiment: make Telegram-like scrollbars: 
		leave option
	scrollbar is not always visible
	add a MouseRegion: on enter whole region, trigger a fake movement to show scrollbar
	while inside the scrollbar region action range, keep showig it
	also show it once at start	
	remove top padding on android by default

TableFromZero improvements
	List<Columns> and List<values> refactored as maps
		this would make it trivial to add/remove columns
		! need to keep compatibility with lists somehow
	Initial checking for filter values should be async (and also maybe other parts of initialization)
			??? also filtering, maybe
		filters will show loading until this finishes
		probably needs to be in an isolate
		??? only if rowCount > 100 ??? (also allow to force sync or async)
	
Return to top button improvement: only show when there is certain space from beggining AND user is scrolling upwards, hide when scrolling down
	maybe add to ScrollbarFromZero by default (probably need to support horizontal scrolling for this)
	
REFACTOR FROMZERO NAVIGATION
	Learn about Navigation 2.0
	Implement PageFromZero, including all info
	Deprecate current hacks for remembering stack

Use better scroll shadow on table
	https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_scroll_shadow

make Export use new FileSaverFromZero

implement PageIndicatorForZero
	indicator that 'slides' with a transition between values
	builders for the actual tab children, depending on selected value/index
implement DialogButton widget to streamline appearance
implement AlertDialogFromZero, taking simple parameters (title, message, onAccept, onCancel)



??? force windows app to be executed as admin by default
