Android -- popupFromZero and SnackBarFromZero don't resize for android keyboard offset appropriately

Problems with excel export
	Excel breaks sometimes when copy/paste ????
	Export breaks when exporting large amounts of data (embarques 3 years)
	!!! test with new version

??? Fix goRouter.go() ignoring willPop commands, this is a MAJOR ISSUE
	go() methods should check the willPop methods of all routes that will be removed
	also make the pushNamedAndMaybeRemoveUntil() method work as expected

fix part of the screen not being draggable on really big screens
	maybe just deprecate limitWidthOnBigScreens
	??? maybe we can apply GestureRelayer, but it seems hard
	
popupFromZero doesn't reposition child in response to window resize

Implement SafeAnimatedSwitcher
	this widget will take an image of the widgets switching out and remove them from the widget tree immediatly
	this will fix duplicate GlobalKey errors caused by AnimatedSwitcher and [hopefully] improove performance

DAO Form Performance -- wait for first validation before painting a frame
	this was the behaviour before, but since the validation is async, now the form paints once before validation, then paints again
	this causes unnecessary paints of even hidden fields
	since awaiting the validation calls could cause other problems (potential long wait), maybe just waiting 1/2 frames before building would be enough

StringField should mark as edited as soon as you start typing
	this is noticeable because save button doesn't light up when typing
	
Table -- fix implicitlyAnimatedTable, make it default for <10 items

Table Feature -- Sticky columns 

Table Feature -- Reorder columns

Table Feature -- Resize columns (hard)

Table Feature -- Column types (String, num, DateTime)
	show sum/avg on num columns
	custom filters for each column type
	
Table Performance -- cancel async/isolate filters computation if disposed

Table bug with arrow key traversal
	
DAO Form -- make errorSign inside textField flicker on highlight like others
	
Implement UIScaling + Scaling picker widget (with slider)
	take initial system textScale as UI scaling

Appbar on top of fromZeroUI should be above header (appbar will span full window width)
	in mobile mode, headerTitle still needs to be painted on the header itself
	this will fix some visual bugs and some bugs with new windowBar

expanded state for actions in mobile view is broken

add icon/title to WindowBar on desktop when aproppriate

APISnackbar -- Implement showError (and maybe retry)

ListField -- implement proper disabled logic 
	take into consideration all possible states: table, collapsed, dense
	implement in each sliver (color + tooltip + mouseRegion)

ComboField improvement
	add a small loading spinner to comboField and listField so you know when possibleValues is refreshing
	this would require checking if a provider is already build, because we dont want to call all providers on start

Windows Increase mouse wheel scroll speed and add animation
	only when the mouse wheel is click (not smooth)
	
popupFromZero improvement: on dektop, popup should not block content behind it by default (use Overlay)

Make FromZeroAppbar expanded widget close only on back button, not on WillPop 
	https://pub.dev/packages/back_button_interceptor
	
Sticky footer bugs when there are more slivers below itself

Organize dependencies
	remove all dependency overrides
	update all to latest
	test for any bugs

Considerations for a new model/dataClass solution
	support normal dart class inheritnce
	easy way to declare states
	easy way to override toString (maybe in parent for different models)
	autommatically implement == and hashCode (customizable, so i can do it from only id)
	autommatically implement Comparable, so it can be used in tables
	generate copyTo
	generate from/to Json
	support immutability
	easy way to declare computed properties

Play around with Provider.autoDispose
	it is impossible to call an autoDispose provider from a non-autoDispose provider
	currently, the ApiProvider solution cannot use autoDispose, which could be a useful feature if enabled

GoRouter -- there should be a way to "push" a subtree, 
	this means the subtree will decide its normally with .go, but wont affect routes below it in the stack
		PROPOSAL:
			create a new custom routeDelegate, 
				that contains a goRouterDelegate and conveys everything to it
				add a new method pushRouter: 
					allows to push a new goRouter, with full functionality, on top of the new one
					when the last page of this new router is popped, the whole router will be popped, returning to previous one
					add an aditional initialRoute parameter when pushing new router
					? impact in the fromZeroScaffold page shenannigans
				! need to read more about default navigator2.0 documentation

Experiment: make Telegram-like scrollbars (leave option)
	scrollbar is not always visible
	add a MouseRegion: on enter whole region, trigger a fake movement to show scrollbar
	while inside the scrollbar region action range, keep showig it
	also show it once at start, then fade out on timing
	
Return to top button improvement: only show when there is certain space from beggining AND user is scrolling upwards, hide when scrolling down
	maybe add to ScrollbarFromZero by default (probably need to support horizontal scrolling for this)

implement PageIndicatorForZero
	indicator that 'slides' with a transition between values
	builders for the actual tab children, depending on selected value/index
	
implement DialogButton widget to streamline appearance

implement AlertDialogFromZero, taking simple parameters (title, message, onAccept, onCancel)
