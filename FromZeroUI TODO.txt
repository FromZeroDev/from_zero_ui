Export
	make Export use new FileSaverFromZero
	export should autommatically open the saved file, default true
		add option to open autommatically to FileSaverFromZero, default false

Table Feature -- Export to excel with right-click (directly on the table)

Table -- Initial checking for filter values should be async (and also maybe other parts of initialization)
			??? also filtering, maybe
		filters will show loading until this finishes
		probably needs to be in an isolate
		??? only if rowCount > 100 ??? (also allow to force sync or async)
		
Android -- popupFromZero and SnackBarFromZero don't resize for android keyboard offset appropriately

Bug with condition filters on table
	when all value filters are disabled (new way) and a condition filter is added, no values return true

??? force windows app to be executed as admin by default

Problems with excel export
	Excel breaks sometimes when copy/paste ????
	Export breaks when exporting large amounts of data (embarques 3 years)

WAITING bug with slivers tearing on windows, once it is solved, remove patches from Table

Table -- fix implicitlyAnimatedTable, make it default for <10 items

fix part of the screen not being draggable on really big screens
	maybe just deprecate limitWidthOnBigScreens
	
popupFromZero doesn't reposition child in response to window resize

Table Feature -- Sticky columns 

Table Feature -- Reorder columns

Table Feature -- Resize columns (hard)

Table -- fix scroll shadow to actually swap states 
	the state notification for stickyHeader using external scrollController does not work
	maybe make the shadow change more noticeable (smaller when not pinned)
	
Windows Increase mouse wheel scroll speed and add anmation
	only when the mouse wheel is click (not smooth)
	
Implement UIScaling + Scaling picker widget (with slider)
	take initial system textScale as UI scaling
	
popupFromZero improvement: on dektop, popup should not block content behind it by default (use Overlay)

Organize dependencies
	remove all dependency overrides
	update all to latest
	test for any bugs

Considerations for a new model/dataClass solution
	support normal dart class inheritnce
	easy way to declare states
	easy way to override toString (maybe in parent for different models)
	autommatically implement == and hashCode (customizable, so i can do it from only id)
	autommatically implement Comparable, so it can be used in tables
	generate copyTo
	generate from/to Json
	support immutability
	easy way to declare computed properties

GoRouter -- there should be a way to "push" a subtree, 
	this means the subtree will decide its normally with .go, but wont affect routes below it in the stack
		PROPOSAL:
			create a new custom routeDelegate, 
				that contains a goRouterDelegate and conveys everything to it
				add a new method pushRouter: 
					allows to push a new goRouter, with full functionality, on top of the new one
					when the last page of this new router is popped, the whole router will be popped, returning to previous one
					add an aditional initialRoute parameter when pushing new router
					? impact in the fromZeroScaffold page shenannigans
				! need to read more about default navigator2.0 documentation

Experiment: make Telegram-like scrollbars (leave option)
	scrollbar is not always visible
	add a MouseRegion: on enter whole region, trigger a fake movement to show scrollbar
	while inside the scrollbar region action range, keep showig it
	also show it once at start, then fade out on timing
	
Return to top button improvement: only show when there is certain space from beggining AND user is scrolling upwards, hide when scrolling down
	maybe add to ScrollbarFromZero by default (probably need to support horizontal scrolling for this)

implement PageIndicatorForZero
	indicator that 'slides' with a transition between values
	builders for the actual tab children, depending on selected value/index
	
implement DialogButton widget to streamline appearance

implement AlertDialogFromZero, taking simple parameters (title, message, onAccept, onCancel)
